"""
Unit tests for Spell Chess game logic.

Run with:
    pytest test_spell_logic.py -v

These tests verify the Spell Chess rules described in SPELL_CHESS_RULES.md.
Each test creates a fresh SpellChessGame, sets up a position, performs an
action, and checks that the result matches the specification.
